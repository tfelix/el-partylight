# Party-EL Arduino Light

This is a little programm for the El Escudo Dos from Sparkfun. It can be used to control EL-Wire.

This script can be used at parties in order to randomly light up the EL wire. In my case I was limited by
my inverter to only light up 5m of wire once, thats why the code makes sure at most only one strand is activated.
